		<h2>Something about me</h2>
		<p>
			I spent the first 18 years of my life on Lake Iseo, an alpine lake in northern Italy, mainly rowing and finding creative excuses not to listen in class.
		</p>

		<p>
			In elementary school, my excuse was crafting origami under my desk for the school-wide business I had started to amass my currency: coloured paper sheets. 
			Once I had a drawer with more paper than I could use in a lifetime, I figured it was time to find a better excuse.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's why, in high school, I started training for Math Olympiad and taking rowing seriously. Fast forward four years, and I had won a Bronze medal at the national math finals, a Gold at the Italian rowing championships and was about to do a solid job in debate competitions as well. <br>
			Debating, I realised what everyone around me knew: I like talking a lot. Thus (...why not?) I opened a podcast, ran for Student Government elections, won them and served for two fun years.
		</p>
		<p>
			Excited about all I was doing, I applied to the best colleges in the US, and I failed. 
			<br>
			But who cares? After one year at Bocconi I ended up in the States anyway: spending my freshman summer in NYC while working at a startup was one of the most enriching experiences of my life.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I'm back in Milan, still juggling being a student, an athlete, and an engineer at the same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			P.S.: for the sake of truth, which I care about deeply, what you read here is the good part; the rest doesn't look as good on a webiste.
