		<h2>Something about me</h2>
		<p>
			I spent the first 18 years of my life on Lake Iseo, an alpine lake in northern Italy, mainly rowing and finding creative excuses not to listen in class.
		</p>

		<p>
			In elementary school, my excuse was crafting origami under my desk for the school-wide business I had started to amass my currency: coloured paper sheets. 
			Once I had a drawer with more paper than I could use in a lifetime, I figured it was time to find a better excuse.
		</p>
		<p>
			In high school, I started training for Math Olympiad and taking rowing seriously. I won a Bronze medal at the national math finals, and a Gold at the Italian rowing championships, Incidentally, I tried debating competitions as well, won a regional Silver, and realised what everyone around me knew: I like talking a lot. Thus I opened a podcast that totalised almost three million views and stepped down into Student Government politics, winning the elections and serving for two fun years.
		</p>
		<p>
			Excited about all I was doing, I applied to the best colleges in the US. I failed.
			After one year at Bocconi, I managed to get to the States anyway. I spent my freshman summer in NYC working at a startup, one of my life's most enriching experiences.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now I'm back in Milan, still juggling being a student, an athlete, and an engineer at the same time.
		</p>
		<p>
			P.S.: for the sake of truth, which I care about deeply, what you read here is the good part; the rest doesn't look as good on a website.
